# Hall-of-Fame-Classifier
Analyzes the Lahman dataset to create Decision Tree models to predict the values of classes relating to nomination and induction of players into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Two classifiers are created:
1. Predicting whether a player will be nominated for the Baseball Hall of Fame. A player would be labelled as 'True' if the player is either inducted or nominated or labelled 'False' if not nominated.
2. Predicting whether a player nominated for the Baseball Hall of Fame will be inducted. This player would be labelled 'True' if the player is inducted and 'False' if they are nominated but not inducted.
